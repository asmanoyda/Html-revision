    <p>Every cookie made at the Kevin Cookie Company is crafted with only the finest ingredients. Butter from grass fed
      cows. Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. Eggs from chickens that
      listen to classical. music. Even our water is special. It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up
      to retrieve.</p>
    <p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
